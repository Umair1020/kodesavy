Innova Solutions has established this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the publicly available portion of www.innovasolutions.pk (the âSiteâ) and through various other interactions with you, and how we may use and share that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site and/or providing us with Personal Information, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or provide us with any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect on the Site and to information which we may collect by other âofflineâ means, including, without limitation, sales calls and other business transactions. A description of the information we collect on behalf of our advertiser clients through our advertising services is set out in our Notice of Marketing Practices.
                                Personal Information
                                Information We May Collect
                                Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home, business, or other physical address, a phone number, and an email address. We collect Personal Information from our Site users and customers only when such information is voluntarily provided to us, including, without limitation, in connection with inquiries about our services through the âContact Usâ page, as part of signing up for our email subscriptions, or in the process of your business transactions with us. To make our content more relevant to you, we may also ask for information about your present place of employment, such as company name, size, industry sector and number of employees. Of course, if you send us an email in connection with an inquiry about a job listed on the âCareersâ page, we may also store the Personal Information provided in connection with that inquiry.
                                We also offer a variety of email subscriptions where you can get information about online marketing and promotions and special offers. You can subscribe to these emails and you can manage your email preferences.

                                How We May Use Your Information
                                If you provide us with Personal Information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes, including facilitating and otherwise addressing your inquiry, request, subscriptions, or business transactions and relationship with Innova Solutions. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to respond to your questions or requests for information about Innova Solutions.

                                We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Site and our e-mail services and processing inquiries. We may provide Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties. Innova Solutions will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on Innova Solutionsâs behalf. Innova Solutions will not sell or share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In the event that Innova Solutions or all of its assets are acquired, all of the data collected by Innova Solutions through the Site and through other means and services provided by Innova Solutions would be among the transferred assets.

We also reserve the right to disclose such information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

                                From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as what sites visitors are coming from when they visit our Site, when they first visited our Site, their IP address, how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they âclickâ on.
